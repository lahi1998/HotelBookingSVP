angular install guide

Step 1: Install Node.js (includes npm)

Angular requires Node.js (which includes npm).

For Windows

Go to the official Node.js website:
https://nodejs.org

Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version (recommended for most users).

Run the installer:

Click Next through the setup.

Keep the default settings.

Make sure the option “Install npm package manager” is checked.

Once installed, open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux) and verify the installation:

node -v
npm -v


You should see version numbers (e.g., v20.x.x for Node and 10.x.x for npm).

Step 2: Install Angular CLI

The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps you create and manage Angular projects.

Run this command in your terminal:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Verify installation

Once it’s done, check the version:

ng version


If it prints Angular CLI information, you’re good to go.

with a angular projekt initialized you can go ng serve in visual studio code's command line and it should launch on a local port
